# DWP Code Test
## Code quality

ESLint is used to ensure that code is written to a good standard. I have used the DWP style guides (`"@dwp/eslint-config-base` and `@dwp/eslint-config-mocha`).
The lint command can be executed using `npm run lint`. This mimics one of the code quality jobs that would take place in a CI/CD pipeline to ensure that
code matched the departmental standards.
