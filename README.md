# 🎟️ Ticket Service Project - Code Test

Welcome to the TicketService project! This service is designed to streamline the process of purchasing and reserving tickets while maintaining a reliable and efficient flow of operations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧪 Running Tests
To ensure every component of the service is operating as expected, I've added unit tests.

### Setup:

Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal or command prompt.

#### Install the required dependencies:
npm install

#### Run the Tests:
npm test

## 🤔 Struggles & Learnings
Throughout the course of this project, I faced several challenges:

**Unfamiliarity:** The project Type being set to Module was a challenge for me to get used to. Also working with classes isn't something I've done a lot.

**Third-party Dependencies**: Integrating with third-party services like TicketPaymentService and SeatReservationService presented unforeseen issues. Ensuring reliability and handling errors was a journey in itself.

**Error Handling:** Providing meaningful error messages while safeguarding sensitive information was a balance we aimed to achieve.

**Validation:** Creating a system to verify all ticket requests proved challenging.

## 🛠️ Things to Improve
Here are some areas I'd like to focus on in future iterations:

**Service Mocking**: To ease development and testing, mocking third-party services would be beneficial.

**Validator Enhancement**: We can extend and modularize the Validator logic for greater flexibility.

**Logging**: A better logging system rather than the console.
